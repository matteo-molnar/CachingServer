# SENG401-G4_CachingServer

There is an unimplemented method in CacheController.

CacheController has not been integrated into the RequestHandler yet.

As of writing this, CacheController "should" be able to save responses into a file(somewhere) locally.

The file name consists of the query parameters mashed together.

PS: Sorry for spaghetti code
